#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson starts with a brief review of pipeline syntax and then asks students to implement this procedure independently for a modelling task on their own. Afterwards, a discussion of the benefits and use cases of pipelines is conducted.

#### Topic:
 
scikit-learn Pipelines

#### Learning goals for this lesson:


* Students will be able to implement a scikit-learn pipeline to modularize a modelling process
* 

#### Prerequisite knowledge:

* Students should have substantial previous experience with pandas and scikit-learn

#### Prequisite Learn-Materials:

* [Introduction to Pipelines](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-pipelines)

#### Post Learn-Materials:

* [Comparing Machine Learning Techniques using Pipelines - Lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-pipelines-lab)

#### Relevant learning goals from Airtable: 

*  PIPELINE.1.recabDcWx2B5QUHCu
*  PIPELINE.2.rec6gdkOJ436VtPQv
*  PIPELINE.4.recUW4i3bC5VOiI2I


#### Materials

* Ipython notebook

#### Vocab / Concepts 

* Pipeline

#### Lesson Outline:

* Introduction / Brief Context Around Pipelines (3 minutes)
* Review Previous PCA Code (5+ minutes)
	* Ask students to explain what's going on in the code sample provided before moving on to building pipelines
* Student Work Time - Adapt the Code into a pipeline (5+ minutes)
	* Review Student solutions (5 minutes)
* Grid Search (5 + minutes)
	* Again, ask students to explain pieces of the grid search code before they adapt it to a pipeline. This should further solidify and reinforce student knowledge.
* Student Work Time - Adapt the Code into a pipeline (5+ minutes)
	* Review Student solutions (5 minutes)
